# PokerGame

This is a game which can only be played by one player vs cpu. 
And in this version, the player can only win whenever there is a combination of cards, if there is no combinaiton, a message will appear
making sure that no one wins the game. This game still has lots of rooms for improvements, and this improvements will be made after some
time. 

PS.: This version of the game, was developed for the first 3 months of learning java.
